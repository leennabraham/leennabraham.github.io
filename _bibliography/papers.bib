    abstract = {Epigenetic modifications are key regulators of gene expression and underpin genome integrity. Yet, how epigenetic changes affect the evolution and transcriptional robustness of genes remains largely unknown. Here, we show how the repressive histone mark H3K27me3 underpins the trajectory of highly conserved genes in fungi. We first performed transcriptomic profiling on closely related species of the plant pathogen Fusarium graminearum species complex. We determined transcriptional responsiveness of genes across environmental conditions to determine expression robustness. To infer evolutionary conservation, we used a framework of 23 species across the Fusarium genus including three species covered with histone methylation data. Gene expression variation is negatively correlated with gene conservation confirming that highly conserved genes show higher expression robustness. In contrast, genes marked by H3K27me3 do not show such associations. Furthermore, highly conserved genes marked by H3K27me3 encode smaller proteins, exhibit weaker codon usage bias, higher levels of hydrophobicity, show lower intrinsically disordered regions, and are enriched for functions related to regulation and membrane transport. The evolutionary age of conserved genes with H3K27me3 histone marks falls typically within the origins of the Fusarium genus. We show that highly conserved genes marked by H3K27me3 are more likely to be dispensable for survival during host infection. Lastly, we show that conserved genes exposed to repressive H3K27me3 marks across distantly related Fusarium fungi are associated with transcriptional perturbation at the microevolutionary scale. In conclusion, we show how repressive histone marks are entangled in the evolutionary fate of highly conserved genes across evolutionary timescales.},

	abstract = {Elephant foot yam (Amorphophallus paeoniifolius (Dennst.) Nicolson), is an important edible tropical tuber crop, belonging to the family Araceae. Corms produced by this plant is very big and they are rich in starch, protein, mineral, vitamins, and dietary fiber but has acridity problem. This crop is susceptible to virus and phytoplasma diseases which affects crop growth and corm yield. Even though this crop has high commercial value, the problems like susceptibility to viral diseases, acridity problems, and lack of genetic diversity made hindrance in their exploitation. These issues can be resolved only by improving the characters through genetic transformation. To achieve genetic transformation in this important crop, a study was conducted to optimize various parameters for efficient Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation using embryogenic calli with vectors having gus reporter gene. Calli were developed using petiole and leaves of in vitro plantlets of elephant foot yam cultivar Gajendra and experiments were conducted to evaluate the sensitivity of calli to different doses of antibiotics viz. geneticin, hygromycin, ticarcillin. It was observed that complete death and discoloration of the calli were obtained with 25 mgl−1 geneticin and 10 mgl−1 hygromycin. The lowest lethal concentration of ticarcillin against Agrobacterium growth was found to be 500 mgl−1 which did not affect calli growth. Optimized parameters for efficient transformation in elephant foot yam include 100 μM acetosyringone concentration with 2 days of co-cultivation at temperature 22 $\,^{\circ}$C using LBA4404 strain. The putative transformants were characterized for the integration of the gus gene using PCR and nucleic acid spot hybridization. The optimized protocol is simple and reproducible and may be adapted for other cultivars also.},

	abstract = {Genome evolution is driven by the activity of transposable elements (TEs). The spread of TEs can have deleterious effects including the destabilization of genome integrity and expansions. However, the precise triggers of genome expansions remain poorly understood because genome size evolution is typically investigated only among deeply divergent lineages. Here, we use a large population genomics dataset of 284 individuals from populations across the globe of \textit{Zymoseptoria tritici}, a major fungal wheat pathogen. We built a robust map of genome-wide TE insertions and deletions to track a total of 2456 polymorphic loci within the species. We show that purifying selection substantially depressed TE frequencies in most populations, but some rare TEs have recently risen in frequency and likely confer benefits. We found that specific TE families have undergone a substantial genome-wide expansion from the pathogen's center of origin to more recently founded populations. The most dramatic increase in TE insertions occurred between a pair of North American populations collected in the same field at an interval of 25 years. We find that both genome-wide counts of TE insertions and genome size have increased with colonization bottlenecks. Hence, the demographic history likely played a major role in shaping genome evolution within the species. We show that both the activation of specific TEs and relaxed purifying selection underpin this incipient expansion of the genome. Our study establishes a model to recapitulate TE-driven genome evolution over deeper evolutionary timescales.},

	abstract = {Despite large omics datasets, the establishment of a reliable gene annotation is still challenging for eukaryotic genomes. Here, we used the reference genome of the major fungal wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici (isolate IPO323) as a case study to develop methods to improve eukaryotic gene prediction. Four previous IPO323 annotations identified 10,933 to 13,260 gene models, but only one third of these coding sequences (CDS) have identical structures. To resolve these discrepancies and improve gene models, we generated full-length transcripts using long-read sequencing. This dataset was used together with other evidence (RNA-Seq transcripts and protein sequences) to generate novel ab initio gene models. The selection of the best structure among novel and existing gene models was performed according to transcript and protein evidence using InGenAnnot, a novel bioinformatics suite. Overall, 13,414 re-annotated gene models (RGMs) were predicted, including 671 new genes among which 53 encoded effector candidates. This process corrected many of the errors (15\%) observed in previous gene models (coding sequence fusions, false introns, missing exons). While fungal genomes have poor annotations of untranslated regions (UTRs), our Iso-Seq long-read sequences outlined 5{\textquoteright} and 3{\textquoteright}UTRs for 73\% of the RGMs. Alternative transcripts were identified for 13\% of RGMs, mostly due to intron retention (75\%), likely corresponding to unprocessed pre-mRNAs. A total of 353 genes displayed alternative transcripts with combinations of previously predicted or novel exons. Long non-coding transcripts (lncRNAs) and double-stranded RNAs from two fungal viruses were also identified. Most lncRNAs corresponded to antisense transcripts of genes (52\%). lncRNAs that were up or down regulated during infection were enriched in antisense transcripts (70\%), suggesting their involvement in the control of gene expression. Our results showed that combining different ab initio gene predictions and evidence-driven curation using InGenAnnot improved the quality of gene annotations of a compact eukaryotic genome. Our analysis also provided new insights into the transcriptional landscape of Z. tritici, helping develop an increasingly complex picture of its biology.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = { ABSTRACT The rapid adaptive evolution of microbes is driven by strong selection pressure acting on genetic variation. How adaptive genetic variation is generated within species and how such variation influences phenotypic trait expression is often not well understood though. We focused on the recent activity of transposable elements (TEs) using deep population genomics and transcriptomics analyses of a fungal plant pathogen with a highly active content of TEs in the genome. Zymoseptoria tritici causes one of the most damaging diseases on wheat, with recent adaptation to the host and environment being facilitated by TE-associated mutations. We obtained genomic and RNA-sequencing data from 146 isolates collected from a single wheat field. We established a genome-wide map of TE insertion polymorphisms in the population by analyzing recent TE insertions among individuals. We quantified the locus-specific transcription of individual TE copies and found considerable population variation at individual TE loci in the population. About 20\% of all TE copies show transcription in the genome suggesting that genomic defenses such as repressive epigenetic marks and repeat-induced polymorphisms are at least partially ineffective at preventing the proliferation of TEs in the genome. A quarter of recent TE insertions are associated with expression variation of neighboring genes providing broad potential to influence trait expression. We indeed found that TE insertions are likely responsible for variation in virulence on the host and potentially diverse components of secondary metabolite production. Our large-scale transcriptomics study emphasizes how TE-derived polymorphisms segregate even in individual microbial populations and can broadly underpin trait variation in pathogens.IMPORTANCE Pathogens can rapidly adapt to new hosts, antimicrobials, or changes in the environment. Adaptation arises often from mutations in the genome; however, how such variation is generated remains poorly understood. We investigated the most dynamic regions of the genome of Zymoseptoria tritici, a major fungal pathogen of wheat. We focused on the transcription of transposable elements. A large proportion of the transposable elements not only show signatures of potential activity but are also variable within a single population of the pathogen. We find that this variation in activity is likely influencing many important traits of the pathogen. Hence, our work provides insights into how a microbial species can adapt over the shortest time periods based on the activity of transposable elements. },

	abstract = {Biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) are often found in fungal pathogens and encode secondary (or specialized) metabolites that play crucial roles in host and niche adaptation. However, the regulatory dynamics and functions of these BGCs during host infection remain largely unknown. To address this gap, we employed interspecies comparative transcriptomics to identify BGCs involved in host-pathogen interactions mediated by the Fusarium graminearum species complex (FGSC). We conducted joint transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses during wheat infection and in vitro experiments with five members of the FGSC to understand gene regulation during host infection. Our findings revealed that expression regulation was predominantly species-specific, but we also identified a set of shared upregulated genes that were common to all five FGSC species showing enrichment for metabolic and pathogenicity-associated functions. We focused on jointly upregulated BGC during infection and identified a NRPS-like gene cluster named SM3. The cluster was highly conserved within FGSC and shared by the more distant F. sambucinum species complex. We show that inactivation of the BGC core gene significantly impairs F. graminearum sensu stricto (s.s.) spore production, reduces fungal spread and Fusarium Head Blight symptoms on wheat kernels. Our results highlight that comparative infection transcriptomes can reveal conserved metabolic functions mediating the host infection process of a plant pathogen.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
