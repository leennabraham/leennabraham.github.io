Hi! I’m Leen Abraham, a postdoctoral researcher in genomics and computational biology, currently based in Germany. My research sits at the intersection of evolutionary biology, functional genomics, and data science, with a strong emphasis on understanding how genetic and epigenetic variation drives adaptation in natural and agricultural ecosystems.

I specialize in developing and applying integrative approaches to study gene regulation, DNA methylation, and structural genome variation in plant and fungal systems. My work combines high-throughput sequencing technologies (e.g., WGBS, RNA-seq, PacBio), statistical modeling, and machine learning to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying phenotypic diversity and environmental responsiveness.

During my PhD, I focused on regulatory polymorphisms and their influence on gene expression in fungal pathogens such as Zymoseptoria tritici. Currently, I work on epigenomic and transcriptomic analyses in Arabidopsis lyrata, exploring how DNA methylation and gene regulation contribute to non-additive genetic effects and trait prediction.

I’m also passionate about reproducible science, FAIR data practices, and developing computational workflows in R, Python, and Snakemake. I regularly collaborate across disciplines and enjoy translating biological questions into data-driven models.

When I’m not coding or running sequencing analyses, I’m often mentoring students and supporting their growth in computational biology. I also love hiking and strolling in nature with my camera, capturing quiet moments and the subtle beauty of wild landscapes.
