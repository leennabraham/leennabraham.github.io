Hi! I’m Leen Abraham, a computational biologist passionate about leveraging big data and genomics to drive data-informed decisions and uncover meaningful biological insights.
<br><br>
Currently based in Germany, I work at the intersection of multiomics and machine learning — combining biological understanding with computational tools to explore how genetic and epigenetic variation shapes complex traits and drives adaptation in natural and agricultural systems.
<br><br>
My journey into computational biology began with a PhD at the University of Neuchâtel in Switzerland, where I studied how subtle changes in DNA affect pathogen evolution through gene expression. Now, as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Cologne, I focus on the heritability of complex traits in plant populations, using large-scale omics datasets, statistical modeling, and machine learning.
<br><br>
Beyond the technical work, I enjoy mentoring, collaborating, and sharing what I learn along the way. I deeply believe that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07530-7" target="_blank">I am a human first — and then a scientist</a>. Holding on to that perspective, I aim to lead with empathy, curiosity, and optimism — not just to grow in science, but to support those around me and help build a more kind, collaborative, and inclusive environment. 
<br><br>
When I’m not immersed in data, you’ll likely find me hiking through forests with a camera in hand, chasing the perfect light and quiet moments that nature offers. </div>
