Hi! I’m Leen Abraham, a computational biologist with a love for big data, genomics and all the fascinating ways living organisms adapt. Currently based in Germany, I work at the crossroads of evolutionary biology, functional genomics, and machine learning — combining biological insights and computational approaches to understand how genetic and epigenetic variation shape life in natural and agricultural systems.
<br><br>
My research journey has taken me deep into the omics world of plants and fungi. As a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Cologne, I investigate how DNA methylation and gene regulation influence complex traits heritability in plant populations, using large-scale omics data, statistical modeling, and machine learning. Before this, during my PhD at the University of Neuchâtel in Switzerland, I explored how subtle changes in DNA drive gene expression and pathogen evolution. My scientific path began in India, where I studied biotechnology and first discovered the excitement of international collaboration during a research fellowship at ETH Zurich.
<br><br>
Beyond the technical side, I’m passionate about making science transparent, reproducible, and collaborative. I enjoy building workflows (with R, Python, and Snakemake), sharing knowledge, and helping others navigate the sometimes challenging, often rewarding world of computational biology. Mentoring students and colleagues has been one of the most meaningful parts of my journey — I believe that a mix of optimism, resilience, and curiosity is key to thriving in science.
<br><br>
When I’m not deep into data or genomes, you’ll probably find me hiking through forests, camera in hand, chasing the perfect light and quiet moments that nature offers. I’m driven by a belief that small discoveries — whether in science or everyday life — can spark big changes.
