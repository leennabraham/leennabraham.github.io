          title: 'Integrating multi-omics for trait heritability prediction in plant populations',
          description: "This project explored the genetic and epigenetic basis of complex traits in Arabidopsis lyrata by integrating genome-wide DNA methylation and transcriptome data from 800 hybrids. Using Bayesian mixed models (brms) and machine learning approaches (PCA, gradient boosting classifiers, Random Forests), we quantified additive and dominance variance components and predicted fitness-related traits. The work combined high-throughput WGBS and RNA-seq data, reproducible multi-omics pipelines (R, Python, Bash), and FAIR data practices, providing insights into trait heritability and breeding value optimization across natural populations.",

          title: 'Intra-Species Epigenetic Variation and Gene Regulation',
          description: "This research focuses on the role of histone modifications—particularly H3K27me3—in regulating gene expression and adaptation in Z. tritici. By profiling 47 field isolates, we uncover extensive population-level variation in H3K27me3 patterns, especially on accessory chromosomes. Genes involved in virulence, metabolism, and stress responses show dynamic epigenetic marking, underscoring the contribution of chromatin-based regulation to pathogen plasticity. Our findings enhance understanding of how epigenetic diversity within species influences the evolutionary trajectories of fungal pathogens.",
